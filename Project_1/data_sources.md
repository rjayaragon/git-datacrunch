## Data Source for Project 1

This project uses synthetic (fake but realistic) data generated using Python Faker library. The following datasets will be used:

- customers.csv**: Basic customer information (customer_id, name, email, location, signup_date)
- products.csv**: Product catalog (product_id, product_name, category, product_price)
- sales.csv**: Sales data (order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, quantity_sold, revenue)

The raw data will be messy and incomplete to simulate real-world scenarios and test ETL data cleaning.
